When we decided to create an integration by configuration solution we used all our many years of experience and insight into the integration challenges of our customers, our employees and business at large to imagine a tool that could help everyone develop more robust integration solutions faster, smarter and cheaper.  With the advent of ConnXio we've reached that goal, and we are proud to announce our solution to the world.

## Integration by Configuration

Some of you may have heard of iPAAS (integration platform as a service) solutions and products, ConnXio falls squarely into this space as well. We call it *Integration by Configuration* and supply our users with a user friendly, robust and pre-defined interface for creating configurations which in turn corresponds directly to an integration which can be edited and released on the fly.

## Robustness

By using a PAAS solution to perform integration and file transfer, the source systems can outsource not only the actual work but also the demands of logging, resending, stability and performance. By using ConnXio you force your solutions into a pattern which gives your internal systems something to keep up with as well as a standard for which to build you own integrations upon when necissary. 

## A tool or a platform

ConnXio can be used both as a tool and a platform. **When used as a tool** it integrates seamlessly into an already established or in progress integration platform as a purveyor of easy to use integration on the fly. In this mode you usually leverage ConnXio where you need to do cookie-cutter integration that is time consuming and often times boring for programmers to deal with. Your core integration flows and large scale advanced transfer needs can also leverage ConnXio as part of the solution or as a last point proxy, but you use the ConnXio tool where appropriate and custom code where not. When used as a tool proxy services between ConnXio and external systems are when necessary or wanted. This mode is mostly used by large integration departments and big business customers.

**When used as a platform** ConnXio acts as a complete integration solution that handles all aspects of integration from fetching of messages to mapping, transformations, enrichment, splitting and eventually sending to external or internal systems. There are usually no proxy's used either from the internal systems or to the external systems. This mode is usually used by smaller integration departments or by businesses who want pure integration as a service.
